image compression, multiplication tests, matrix decomposition, etc.


'multiplication_exptcomplete.m' tries a few matlab matrix multiplication methods, averages runtimes, and plots the runtimes
to see which ones perform the best on average

'solvediag' is a quick function for solving linear systems using matlab's matrix division (used in 'A3_mldivide_tests.m') 

'A3_mldivide_tests.m' tests runtimes of solving linear systems that are perturbed by different amounts and outputs the stats
